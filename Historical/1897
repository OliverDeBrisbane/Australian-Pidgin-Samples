###1897, BOGAN RIVER###
A slightly different account of Cunningham's death used to be given by a blackfella name Billy on 
Messrs Hunt Brothers Burdenda station, on one of the banks of which—Upper Tabratong West—Cunningham's grave 
is situated. Billy died about 1870. He stated that he was present as a boy at the murder.
His account was 'Baal dat pfellar batter (eat). He bin gry, gry, gry all day and eat 'im grass.
Debildebil sit down long a dat pfellar, mine tink it. By-um-by put 'im down gun, pick-um up grass, eat 'im. 
Blackfella come up behind-huh!' - illustrating by a blow of a fist on the back of his own head, 
and then by a quiver of his limbs, the death agony of poor Cunningham. I visited the grave in 1878, and wrote a letter to one of 
the Sydney papers urging that something should be done to repair the dilapidated fence, etc., but no notice was taken of the 
epistle.
