###1890, MAITLAND###
Mr. T. W. Edgworth David, F.G.S. — Apropos of the food of the Aborigines it may be of interest to some of 
the members to know that the Aborigines in Maitland District at all events were particularly fond 
of the fruit of the Macrozamia. 
Mr. Elliott who used to reside there,  … Mr. Elliott told me there was a black who lived at his selection, 
and did not migrate like the others, because he said the whole of Mr. Elliott's selection was on a bit of
land the King of the tribe gave to him, and he always resided permanently upon it. 
This black knew the life history of nearly every living creature on this piece of land, 
and he particularly studied the snakes. One day Mr. Elliott saw a large black snake near his hut, 
and killed it. Presently this blackfella came up in a terrible state of indignation,
"What you done? Why do that? Why you kill that fella? Me watch that fella this long time. 
That fella not fat enough yet. Me wanted by and by to kill and eat him when get fat enough." 
It shows what kind of observation they take of the different classes of food on which they set special value, 
especially snake preserves.
